# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Member Data Visualization

## 🎯 Project Overview
As someone who loves perfecting my own weekly gym split, I wanted to dive into a dataset of gym members to uncover trends in how different people train, eat, and set their fitness goals. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Google Colab
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

## 🔍 Visualizations I Built
In this notebook, I explored the data by creating several custom visualizations:
1. **Demographics & Goals:** Bar and Pie charts breaking down primary fitness goals (muscle gain vs. fat burn) and BMI categories across different genders.
2. **Dietary Word Clouds:** Side-by-side word clouds analyzing the most common foods in the meal plans of guys versus girls.
3. **Goal vs. BMI Heatmap:** A relational heatmap showing the concentration of different fitness goals across BMI categories.
4. **Step Count Scatter Plot:** A 2D strip plot extracting numerical step counts from text data to see how daily steps relate to a person's BMI.
